				<p>Glad you could stumble upon this page! My name is Hamza Ashraf. I am a graduate in software engineering who enjoys anime a lot. Whilst I am not a diehard/hardcore watcher
				of anime (only seen around 10 shows :P) I do however still enjoy talking about it, making any form of content and giving my opinion on different shows that I am vocal about. It was tough for me
					to decide what to create this website on as a personal project however, because of the diveristy of anime seeing as there are a lot of shows out there, I thought this would be a great idea,
					to build a small platform where I can post anything needed. And thus, Animatrix was born!

				<p>One day around 2014, I decided to start watching the first season of Attack on Titan due to a friend recommending me the show. Watching this made me more and more interested
				in the other shows in anime because I enjoyed the first season very much. Since then, I have explored more and more genres and shows available and is now something of great
			interest to me as it is with millions and millions of other across the world. As more and more shows release, more and more fans are made and it creates for excitement!</p>
